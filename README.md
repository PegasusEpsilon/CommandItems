# CommandItems
Voodoo Magic for Minecraft 1.12.2 server admins and map makers.

Basically, lets you add NBT Data to items, so that you can trigger sequences of commands when you left-and-right-click
them on blocks, entities, or thin air. It's already capable of a lot, but it's not capable of everything I want, yet.
